# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple and modern web version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Itâ€™s built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## What it does

- Lets two players enter their names and take turns playing on a 3x3 grid.
- Dynamically shows whose turn it is and updates the board as players make moves.
- Display the appropiate message when someone wins or when the game ends in a tie.

## Why I built it

Fun project to practice building interactive web apps with clean, modular JavaScript. It also gave me a chance to style a simple game with a modern look and smooth user experience.
